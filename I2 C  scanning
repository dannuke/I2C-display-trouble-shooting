The original sketch included an IP address 0X3F
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x3F, 16, 2); Text did not diplay.
I scanned the LCD12C with the following sketch, below.
 The serial monitor read: 12C device found at 0x27.
 I changed  the sketch line to 
 LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27F, 16, 2);
 LCD still did not read text. I removed the letter F.
 Final sketch line is
 LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);
 The dispaly functioned properly.
